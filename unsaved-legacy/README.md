# Unsaved Legacy

There was just me, a screen, and the feeling that something could be built out of nothing. No version control, no backups, no cloud. Just files saved on a laptop 💻. Year after year, device after device, the code never made it to the next machine. It just stayed behind and eventually disappeared.

Nobody taught me how to code. There were no bootcamps, no YouTube tutorials, no Stack Overflow answers in my language. Just view-source on other people's websites, trial and error, and the stubborn belief that if something works on screen, I can figure out how it was made.

I didn't know what a framework was. I didn't know what an API was. I just opened a text editor and typed until something happened in the browser. And when it broke — which was often — I'd delete everything and start again. No git reset. Just delete 🗑️.

What remains are these screenshots — blurry, low-resolution proof that it was real.

It started with a blog. Just a **WordPress site**, nothing fancy. But it was mine. My first little corner of the internet 🌐. A place to write, to exist online, to feel like I was part of something bigger than my room and my laptop. The blog lived for years — this screenshot is from somewhere near the end, not the beginning. The early version looked different. But I never thought to capture it when it was just getting started.

Then came **Parsamehr System** — my first real project. A school management system. I built the whole thing, start to finish. But it was never accepted by the education system 🚫. It never went live. All that work, and nobody ever used it. That one hurt. But it was also the first time I built something complete — something that could have been real. And that was enough to keep going.

At some point the phone started ringing 📞. People wanted websites. Real ones. Ones that handled money and customers and bookings. **Safarino** was an online booking system — built from scratch, no templates, no guides. Just a young man figuring out how payment gateways work at 3 AM 🌙. The company is gone now. The domain expired years ago. But for a while, real people booked real trips through something I built alone.

Behind Safarino, there was **Chamedoon** — the back-office that held everything together. The admin panel where operators managed rooms, reservations, and pricing. It was the invisible machine behind the curtain 🎭. Nobody saw it except the people who needed it, and it had to work perfectly because there was no one else to fix it if it didn't. If you look closely, it might look like the Parsamehr project. You'd be right — the project that was never accepted finally found its way into something real.

Then there was **Eghamat24** — my first real professional role. A hotel booking website. I was the first developer who worked on this system. Built when online hotel booking in Iran was still a new idea. This was where I stopped being a kid who codes and started being a developer 👨‍💻. Unlike the others, this one survived. It's still running today, years later, long after my code was rewritten. But it started with me, on my laptop. This screenshot is from a later version — the first one looked nothing like this.

**Parvazyab** came next. A flight ticket booking platform. Search for a flight, pick a seat, pay online ✈️. For a while, real passengers found real flights through something I built. The business shut down eventually — the market was brutal and the competition had more money 💰. But the code worked. It always worked. This screenshot is from one of the later versions — by the time I thought to capture it, the project had already changed a lot from where it started.

I built a **tourism map** once. Every hotel across Iran, plotted on an interactive map 🗺️. You could browse by city, zoom in, see details. It felt futuristic at the time — dragging a map around in a browser and watching data load in real time. It felt like the future loading right in front of me.

There was a **comic strip viewer** too — because not everything had to be serious 😄. A web app where you could read comics panel by panel, with smooth transitions and reactive behavior. I built it for fun, just to see if I could. Nobody asked for it. Nobody paid for it. It was just pure joy of building something that felt alive in the browser.

Somewhere in between, a company trusted me to build their **internal dashboard**. The system that ran their daily operations — tasks, reports, workflows. Nothing public, nothing flashy. Just a young developer given the keys to a company's backbone 🔑, hoping I wouldn't break anything. I didn't.

And then there was **VLearn**. A video-based learning management system. Upload courses, track progress, manage students. Online education through a browser — years before online learning became the norm. A friend asked me to build it, and I did — for free 🤝, just because I could.

These are just the ones I had screenshots of. There were many others — projects I built that I never captured, screenshots that got lost with the machines they were saved on. Gone forever 💨. Not even a blurry image to prove they existed.

None of this code exists anymore. No repositories. No commit history. No branches or tags. Just these few screenshots, pulled from old folders on old machines, and the memory of late nights alone — debugging by instinct, deploying by prayer 🙏, and learning everything the hard way.

Most projects here were built without a mentor, without a team, without a safety net. Some of them made money. Some of them helped people. Most of them are gone now.

It's good that we now have GitHub and the cloud to keep our work safe over time ☁️. Back then, there was nothing like that — or at least, I didn't know there was.

I built my life in code. And I'm still building 🚀.
