## The Journey

I was building long before GitHub — self-taught, no backups, no team. The code is gone, but the [screenshots survived](unsaved-legacy/). From **PHP** and **C#** to **JavaScript** everywhere, then **Vue.js**, **Svelte**, **VS Code extensions**, and **developer tools** — that's when I found what I love: making things that help others make things. Now it's **TypeScript**, **Go**, **Swift**, AI tooling, and whatever problem shows up next. Fifteen years in. Still building 🚀.
